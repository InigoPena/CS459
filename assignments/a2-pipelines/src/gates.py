Data gates. THIS IS THE OTHER FILE YOU EDIT (Part 3).

A gate is a function that looks at one date's joined deliveries (the output of
stage 2) and decides whether the pipeline should trust them. Every gate runs on
every date, after stage 2 and before stage 3.

A gate is registered with the @gate decorator and declares what the runner does
when it fires:

    on_fail="fail"        stop the run, exit non-zero, write nothing for this date
    on_fail="warn"        write the partition anyway, record the warning in the manifest
    on_fail="quarantine"  write the partition to data/quarantine/ instead of data/aggs/
    on_fail=None          not decided. The runner treats this as "warn" and records that
                          nobody chose. Warn-and-continue is what you get by not deciding.

A gate receives:

    ctx      the run Context (src/runner.py). ctx.dt is the date being built,
             ctx.con is a DuckDB connection.
    joined   the name of a view over this date's stage 2 output. Its columns are:
             order_id, restaurant_id, customer_zone, placed_at, cart_size, cart_value,
             delivered_at, delivery_date, prep_time_minutes, delivery_minutes, distance_km
             It holds the trailing window too, so `WHERE delivery_date = ctx.dt` is today
             and earlier dates are history you can compare against.

and returns a GateResult(passed, observed, expected, detail). Everything but
`passed` is just recorded in the manifest so a person can see why it fired.
