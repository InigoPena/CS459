"""
The nightly feature job. THIS IS THE FILE YOU FIX.

Four stages, one partition per date. For a date D it builds `aggs/dt=D`: one row
per restaurant with that restaurant's rolling statistics, which is the feature
vector for any order placed on D.

    1. read_events      read the raw orders and deliveries this run needs
    2. join_deliveries  join them, drop orders that have no delivery
                        (the gates in src/gates.py run here)
    3. rolling_aggs     per-restaurant statistics over a trailing window
    4. write_aggs       publish the partition to the feature table

Each stage gets a Context (see src/runner.py) and writes its output into
`ctx.stage_dir`. The next stage reads it with `ctx.output_of("<stage>")`.

Every value in aggs/dt=D must be something that was knowable before D began:
the row is used to predict orders placed on D, so it may not contain anything
from D itself.
